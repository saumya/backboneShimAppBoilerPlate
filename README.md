backboneShimAppBoilerPlate
==========================

A boilerplate application to get started with backboneJS and with its Shim configuration utility.

This is started to get the Shim configuration understanding of RequireJS and how well it plays with BackboneJS.
Finally made a boilerplate for this kind of Applications.

Hope it helps someone out there.
